This is the AFIDS version of xvd. This is considerably more complicated to
build than other AFIDS code, and it also depends on the presence of the motif
librarys. So we have separated this out as it own build.

Note that xvd is the only program that depends on the VICAR GUI and MotifApp
libraries. So we build those libraries here, rather than as part of 
vicar-rtl. If this every becomes an issue, we can shift this around. But
given how old this code is, that seems unlikely.
